# Machine Learning Case Studies

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Case Studies** repository! This collection contains a series of independent machine learning case studies that I have personally explored and experimented with. Each folder within this repository represents a distinct case study, and you will find the raw data for each study contained within its respective folder.

## Overview

In this repository, I have documented my journey through various real-world problems and applied machine learning techniques to gain insights and make predictions. Each case study focuses on a specific problem domain, and I've strived to make the code and explanations as clear and accessible as possible.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Case_Study_1/`: This folder contains all the materials for the first machine learning case study.
  - `data/`: Raw data files used for the analysis and modeling.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
  - `summary/`: Any relevant output or visualizations generated during the analysis.

- `Case_Study_2/`: Similar to Case Study 1, this folder contains materials for the second machine learning case study.

- `Case_Study_3/`: ... and so on for additional case studies.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the various case studies and delve into the specific problem domains that interest you the most. Each case study is independent, allowing you to focus on the ones that align with your learning objectives or catch your attention.

To get started with a case study, navigate to the corresponding folder, and open the Jupyter notebook provided. These notebooks serve as a step-by-step guide, taking you through the entire process from data loading and exploration to model training and evaluation. Additionally, you can access the raw data within each case study's `data/` folder.

## Contribution and Feedback

I'm open to contributions and feedback! If you have any suggestions for improvement, spot any issues, or have additional case study ideas, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. This repository is meant to be a collaborative space for learning and sharing machine learning knowledge.
